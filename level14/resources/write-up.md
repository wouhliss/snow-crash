# Level14 Write-up

## Objective:

The goal of this level was to reverse-engineer the `getflag` binary to find the correct password for the `flag14` user. The correct password was derived by analyzing the `ft_des` function and matching it with the correct user ID (`uid`) of the `flag14` user.

## Step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Analyzing the `getflag` Binary

I started by analyzing the `getflag` binary in **Ghidra**. During the reverse-engineering process, I discovered that the binary was checking multiple user IDs (`uid`), and for each `uid`, there was a specific password that was validated using the `ft_des` function.

### Step 2: Finding the `flag14` User ID

We found `flag14` User ID in the `/etc/passwd` file.

### Step 3: Identifying the Correct `ft_des` Input

By inspecting the binary further, I found that the correct password for the `flag14` user was generated by passing the string `"g <t61:|4_|!@IF.-62FH&G~DCK/Ekrvvdwz?v|"` to the `ft_des` function.

### Step 4: Running the `ft_des` Function

Next, I ran the `ft_des` function with the string `"g <t61:|4_|!@IF.-62FH&G~DCK/Ekrvvdwz?v|"`.
